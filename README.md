# Tumor Detection and Segmentation

This Github repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a deep learning model for detecting and segmenting tumors in medical images. The model is designed to process MRI and CT scans and uses state-of-the-art techniques to accurately identify tumor regions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* TensorFlow 2
* Keras
* Numpy
* OpenCV


## Architecture

The model is based on a U-Net architecture and is trained on a large dataset of annotated medical images. The implementation is highly modular, allowing for easy customization and experimentation with different hyperparameters and network architectures.
